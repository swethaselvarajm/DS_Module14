# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize an array to store priority queue elements and a size variable.
2. Insert elements into the queue maintaining priority order (higher value = higher priority).
3. Delete elements by removing the element with the highest priority.
4. Display the queue elements after insertion and deletion. 
5. Repeat operations as needed.  

## Program:
```

```
/*
/*#include <stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  int i;
  for(i=0;i<size;i++)
  {
      printf("%d ",array[i]);
  }
  //type your code here...
}
*/
```
