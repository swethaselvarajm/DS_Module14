# Ex8 Deque
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C function to count the number of elements present in the deque.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize a counter variable.
2. Traverse the deque array from the first to the last element.
3. For each element, check if it is non-zero (or not empty).
4. Increment the counter for each valid element. 
5. Return the total count.  

## Program:
```

```
```
/*
int count(int *arr) {
  int c = 0, i;

  for (i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
    if (arr[i] != 0)
      c++;
  }
  return c;
}
*/
```

## Result:
Thus, the C code to count the number of elements present in the deque is implemented successfully.
